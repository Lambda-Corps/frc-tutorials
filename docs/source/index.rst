Welcome to FRC Tutorials!
===================================

**FRC Tutorials** is designed to supplement the `Official WPILib Documentation <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html>`_.

The goal of the project is to create more detailed guides, with specific ends. Ideally, this site is aimed at raising the floor for FRC teams getting started.

After working through the various tutorials herein, hopefully your team will be able to guarantee some measure of success.  Whether that success means consitently driving in Teleop as well as Autonomous for those free movement points, or to make your way to field-centric driving with generated trajectories, hopefully there's something here to help your team.

Please let the maintainers know, or better yet, create a Pull Request with new ideas that may be helpful to the greater community.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
