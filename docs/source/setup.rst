Host Setup
------------

In order to do any development for FRC robots in the simulator, the entire WPILib tool suite needs to be setup on your host machine.  The setup steps are found on the `Official WPILib Installation <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html>`_ steps, specifically Step 2.

Once those steps have bene followed, you should have the following complete:
#. VS Code installed on your host with the WPILib Extension
#. Any software libraries required for 3rd-Party vendors
#. The WPILib JDK 
#. The full complement of WPILib tools, such as Glass, Shuffleboard, and SysID.
